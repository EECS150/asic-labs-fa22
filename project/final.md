## Final Project Deliverables

By now you should have designed a fully-functional processor from scratch! Your design should pass all assembly tests at your reported maximum frequency. Your
design should also pass all of the benchmark tests in at your reported maximum frequency, and you
should report the cycle count for each of those tests. By the due date (Monday, May 9, 2022), each
team needs to push their final commits to their team’s git repository. Only the final commit before the
due date will be graded, so be very, very careful that you have submitted everything required. To be
graded you must submit the following items:
* `src/*.v`
* `build/syn-rundir/reports/*`
* `build/par-rundir/timingReports/*`
* `build/par-rundir/innovus.log*`

These files will be used to check processor functionality and will show us your critical path, maximum operating frequency and area. During the interview session (Friday, December 9, 2022), the
professors and the GSI will be interviewing each team to gauge understanding of various concepts
learned in the project, understand more about each team’s design process, and provide feedback. Your
final report needs to answer the following questions:

1. Show the final pipeline diagram, and explain the functionality of different submodules in your design, how control signals are generated, memory structure, etc.

2. What is the post-synthesis critical path length? What sections of the processor does the critical
path pass through? Why is this the critical path?

3. Show a screenshot of the final floorplan. Also include a screenshot of the clock tree debugger results.  Discuss your floorplanning strategy and the quality of your clock tree results.

4. What is the post-place-and-route critical path length? What sections of the processor does the
critical path pass through? Why is this the critical path? If it is different from the post-synthesis
critical path, why?

5. What is the area utilization of the final design? Also include the total core area you used in PnR and the density.

6. What is the Innovus-estimated power consumption of the final design?

7. What is the number of cycles that your design takes to run the benchmarks? What changes/optimizations
have you done to try and optimize for these tests?

8. What is the post-place-and-route runtime (in seconds) of each benchmark? 
   *Use the number of cycles from RTL simulation, and minimum clock period to meet timing for place-and-route (design doesn't have to pass post-PAR simulations with this clock period).*
   
9. If there are bugs in your design still, explain what is working and what isn't.  What was your debugging process?  Where are the bugs localized?

10. Explain any other optimizations you made for your design.

11. Is there anything you would like to tell the staff before we grade your project?


If you worked with a partner you do not need separate reports. If you are having issues with your
partner please contact the GSI privately as soon as possible.

<b>***The project report is due at 11:59 pm on Monday, Dec. 12. <\b>
